# Names of strategies I've implemented

### Sitting Duck [ pool ]

Sits in a single pool the whole time.

### Random [ pool ]

Sits in a single pool the whole time.


### SlowRandom [ period ]

Waits the given number of ticks, then switches to a random pool.


### CheckLastRound

Moves to whichever pool had fewest agents in the previous round. Technically adaptive but very bad!

### FavorStable [ rest-min rest-max ]

Stay in Stable for some number of turns (random between rest-min and rest-max). Then switch to a random risk pool. Wait until it pays off, then switch back to stable and repeat (with a new rest period between rest-min and rest-max).



# Attributes

Naive: does not take into consideration previous agent behavior.

Adaptive: does depend on previous agent behavior.
